# AKKA HTTP INTRO
The Akka HTTP modules implement a full server- and client-side HTTP stack on top of akka-actor and akka-stream. It is a general toolkit for providing and consuming HTTP-based services.  Akka HTTP will merely be used for the HTTP integration needs.

Mind that akka-http comes in two modules: akka-http-experimental and akka-http-core. Because akka-http-experimental depends on akka-http-core you don't need to bring the latter explicitly. Still you may need to this in case you rely solely on low-level API.


#Akka HTTP Stream Interfaces
**HTTP CLIENT SIDE** (from your app to other app) ==> is a function where you stuck in requests and get out responses. (HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpEntity)

**HTTP SERVER SIDE** (other app to your app) ==> is more or less a function that turns request into responses. (Server-side routing DSL) 

#Webserver
You start with creating a webserver. A new HTTP server can be launched using the Http() class.
The bindAndHandle() method starts a new HTTP server at the given endpoint and uses the given handler (i.e., the akka http route) Flow
for processing all incoming connections.  So the Route created using the Route DSL is  "bound" to a port to start serving HTTP requests, example:
   Http().bindAndHandle(handler = route, interface = "localhost", port = 8080)

#CoreServices
Akka-http is based on Akka and like everything dependend on this library it needs ActorSystem to run. There is no difference here, so we need an ActorSystem. 

Moreover, there is another 'Core Service' needed and that is an Materializer. Like Actor needs the ActorSystem - Flows needs a Materializer to operate. But what is Flow? Flow is a part of Akka-Stream, and in short: Flow is a pipe for transporting data;

Thirdly, an ExecutionContext is needed. 

#Routing DSL for HTTP servers
The high-level, routing API of Akka HTTP provides a DSL to describe HTTP "routes" and how they should be handled. You can complete a
request with any kind of object a as long as there is an implicit marshaller available in scope.

One of the strengths of Akka HTTP is that streaming data is at its heart meaning that both request and response bodies can be
streamed through the server achieving constant memory usage even for very large requests or responses.
Streaming responses will be backpressured by the remote client so that the server will not push data faster than
the client can handle, streaming requests means that the server decides how fast the remote client can push the data of the request body.

Next to that, Akka HTTP routes easily interacts with actors. Meaning that you can also use the actor functionality inside your route.

#HTTP client API
In contrast, to creating a webserver and routes you can also create client API's. The client APIs provide methods
for calling a HTTP server using the same HttpRequest and HttpResponse abstractions that Akka HTTP server uses
but adds the concept of connection pools to allow multiple requests to the same server to be handled more
performantly by re-using TCP connections to the server.

#Route TestKit
One of Akka HTTP's design goals is good testability of the created services. For services built with the Routing DSL
Akka HTTP provides a dedicated testkit that makes efficient testing of route logic easy and convenient.
This "route test DSL" is made available with the akka-http-testkit module.

#2. Common Abstractions (Client- and Server-Side)

**2.1 HTTP Model**

**HttpRequest** and **HttpResponse** are the basic case classes representing HTTP messages.

**An HttpRequest consists of:**

1. a method (GET, POST, etc.)
2. a URI
3. a seq of headers
4. an entity (body data)
5. a protocol

**An HttpResponse consists of**
1. a status code
2. a seq of headers
3. an entity (body data)
4. a protocol


#3. Marshalling
"Marshalling" is the process of converting a higher-level (object) structure into some kind of lower-level representation, often a "wire format" (json, xml or binary encodings).
Other popular names for it are "Serialization" or "Pickling".

In Akka HTTP "Marshalling" means the conversion of an object of type T into a lower-level target type, e.g. a MessageEntity
(which forms the "entity body" of an HTTP request or response) or a full HttpRequest or HttpResponse.

Marshalling of instances of type A into instances of type B is performed by a Marshaller[A, B].
Akka HTTP also predefines a number of helpful aliases for the types of marshallers that you'll likely work with most:

1. type ToEntityMarshaller[T] = Marshaller[T, MessageEntity]
2. type ToHeadersAndEntityMarshaller[T] = Marshaller[T, (immutable.Seq[HttpHeader], MessageEntity)]
3. type ToResponseMarshaller[T] = Marshaller[T, HttpResponse]
4. type ToRequestMarshaller[T] = Marshaller[T, HttpRequest]

for more information see: http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.8/scala/http/common/marshalling.html

#4. Unmarshalling
"Unmarshalling" is the process of converting some kind of a lower-level representation, often a "wire format" (json, xml or binary encodings),
into a higher-level (object) structure. Other popular names for it are "Deserialization" or "Unpickling". In Akka HTTP "Unmarshalling"
means the conversion of a lower-level source object, e.g. a MessageEntity (which forms the "entity body" of an HTTP request or response)
or a full HttpRequest or HttpResponse, into an instance of type T. Simple explained, it is the conversion of xml, json or some
binary encoding to a custom type like Order (i.e., case class).

The unmarshalling infrastructure of Akka HTTP relies on a type-class based approach, which means that Unmarshaller
instances from a certain type A to a certain type B have to be available implicitly.

#5. JSON Support
Akka HTTP's marshalling and unmarshalling infrastructure makes it rather easy to seamlessly support specific wire
representations of your data objects, like JSON, XML or even binary encodings.
For JSON Akka HTTP currently provides support for spray-json right out of the box through it's akka-http-spray-json module.

The SprayJsonSupport trait provides a FromEntityUnmarshaller[T] & ToEntityMarshaller[T] for every type T that
an implicit spray.json.RootJsonReader and/or spray.json.RootJsonWriter (respectively) is available for.

This is how you enable automatic support for (un)marshalling from and to JSON with spray-json:

1. Add the following library in your build.sbt --> "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-http-spray-json-experimental" % "2.4.8".
2. import akka.http.scaladsl.marshallers.sprayjson.SprayJsonSupport._ or mix in the akka.http.scaladsl.marshallers.sprayjson.SprayJsonSupport trait for instance like this: trait JsonMarshallers extends DefaultJsonProtocol with SprayJsonSupport
3. Provide a RootJsonFormat[T] for your type and bring it into scope. For intance like this:

	  **implicit val orderJsonFormat = jsonFormat4(Order)**
	   
      **implicit val itemResponseJsonFormat = jsonFormat1(ItemResponse)**

Once you have done this (un)marshalling between JSON and your type T should work nicely and transparently.

#XML Support
For XML Akka HTTP currently provides support for Scala XML right out of the box through it's akka-http-xml module.

The ScalaXmlSupport trait provides a FromEntityUnmarshaller[NodeSeq] & ToEntityMarshaller[NodeSeq] that you can use directly or build upon.

This is how you enable support for (un)marshalling from and to JSON with Scala XML NodeSeq:

1. Add a library dependency into your build.sbt "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-http-xml-experimental" % "1.x".
2. import akka.http.scaladsl.marshallers.xml.ScalaXmlSupport._ or mix in the akka.http.scaladsl.marshallers.xml.ScalaXmlSupport trait, for instance like this: trait XmlMarshallers extends ScalaXmlSupport 


Once you have done this (un)marshalling between XML and NodeSeq instances should work nicely and transparently. However, they still need to be in scope!

#AKKA HTTP AND AKKA STREAMS
Since Akka HTTP is a library built on top of Akka Streams it offers the possibility to expose an incoming connection in the form of a Source instance: applying backpressure on this Source will make Akka HTTP stop consuming data from the network: in due time this will lead to a 0 TCP window, effectively applying the backpressure on the sending party itself. Example of an AKKA HTTP route that implements streams is presented below:

```
val route =
  path("data") {
    post {
     extractRequest { request =>

       val source = request.entity.dataBytes
       val flow = processing()
       val sink = Sink.ignore

       source.via(flow).runWith(sink)

      // more stuff here

    }
  }
  
  // example taken from: 
  // http://www.measurence.com/tech-blog/2016/06/01/a-dive-into-akka-streams.html
```
There are four things that should be noted in the above code:

- the source is extracted from the request.
- Akka Streams provide simple **Sources** and **Sinks** that can work with **ByteString instances to perform operations on**. There the following line is used: ```request.entity.dataBytes```. The content of a ByteString is a sequence of bytes instead of characters. You can use the "utf8String" method to decodes this ByteString as a UTF-8 encoded String.
- the flow should containt the application logic
- the Sink just ignores everything because this way you can  keep all the logic in the form of a flow (itâ€™s easier to test) so that the only task for the sink is to start the pulling.
